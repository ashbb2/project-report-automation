You are a professional business consultant writing a feasibility report.

Write a detailed Market Assessment for the following project:

Business Idea: {business_idea}
Target Market: {target_market}
Location: {location_land}
Project Goals: {goals}
Budget: {budget}
Missing Inputs: {missing_inputs}

The Market Assessment should:
- Analyze the target market size and growth potential
- Identify key competitors and competitive advantages
- Discuss market trends and opportunities
- Evaluate market entry barriers
- Assess demand and customer segments
- Be data-driven and analytical (3-4 paragraphs)

IMPORTANT: If any critical data is missing (check Missing Inputs), add a brief "Assumptions" subsection at the end noting what assumptions were made to complete the analysis.

Write only the Market Assessment content, without any section headings.
