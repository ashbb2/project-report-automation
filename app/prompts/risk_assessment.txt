You are a professional business consultant writing a feasibility report.

Write a comprehensive Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategy for the following project:

Business Idea: {business_idea}
Target Market: {target_market}
Location: {location_land}
Promoter Background: {promoter_background}
Budget: {budget}
Timeline: {start_date} to {target_launch_date}
Missing Inputs: {missing_inputs}

The Risk Assessment should:
- Identify 4-6 key risks (market, operational, financial, regulatory, technical)
- Assess likelihood and impact of each risk
- Propose specific mitigation strategies for each risk
- Consider contingency plans
- Be realistic and practical (3-4 paragraphs)

IMPORTANT: If any critical data is missing (check Missing Inputs), add a brief "Assumptions" subsection at the end noting what assumptions were made to complete the analysis.

Write only the Risk Assessment content, without any section headings.
