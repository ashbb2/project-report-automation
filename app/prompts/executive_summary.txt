You are a professional business consultant writing a feasibility report.

Write a comprehensive Executive Summary for the following project:

Business Idea: {business_idea}
Target Market: {target_market}
Location: {location_land}
Project Goals: {goals}
Budget: {budget}
Timeline: {start_date} to {target_launch_date}
Missing Inputs: {missing_inputs}

The Executive Summary should:
- Be concise (2-3 paragraphs)
- Highlight key value propositions
- Summarize market opportunity
- Mention critical success factors
- Be professional and objective

IMPORTANT: If any critical data is missing (check Missing Inputs), add a brief "Assumptions" subsection at the end noting what assumptions were made to complete the analysis.

Write only the Executive Summary content, without any section headings.
